### 📝 Experiment Objectives  
In this experiment, students will create three **small LAN designs** in **Cisco Packet Tracer** to understand how *network topology influences connectivity, fault tolerance, and performance*. Students will configure end devices with IPv4 addressing and verify communication using ICMP.

### 📔 Learning Outcomes
- Create small networks in Packet Tracer using different topologies
- Assign IP addresses correctly and test connectivity
- Identify failure points in different physical layouts
- Compare topology behavior using simulation results

### 🧰 Concepts Used  
- Star / Hub-based / Loop (ring-like) layouts  
- IPv4 addressing and subnetting  
- ICMP ping
- Packet Tracer Simulation Mode

### ▶️ Steps to Run the Project

1. **Download Cisco Packet Tracer**

2. **Download/Clone this repository**  
   *(You can manually install from the notebook cells or create a `requirements.txt` using pip freeze)*  
   ```bash
   gh repo clone aaagairi/CN_Assignment-1
   cd cn-assignment-1
   ```

3. **Open Packet Tracer and Import .pkt file**  
   - Click on File menu
   - Select Open option
   - Choose the *2301730104_exp1_topologies.pkt*

4. **Run Simulation**
